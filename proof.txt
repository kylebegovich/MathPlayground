It stands to show that there are infinitely many deletable primes.

Note: this is being conducted in base-10 arithmetic,
  operations of removing, appending, or prepending digits depend on the base,
  and there is a distinct dependency in this proof on base-10 operations

First, define a deletable prime as a prime number that maintains the following recursive property:
  (1) The number is prime
  (2) Either:
    (A) This number is a single digit prime (2, 3, 5, or 7)
    OR (B) There exists a digit of this prime number such that when you remove that
          digit, the resulting number is a deletable prime

An example of a deletable prime is 87253.
  87253 is itself prime,
    when you remove the 2, 8753 is also prime
    when you remove the 7, 853 is also prime
    when you remove the 8, 53 is also prime
    when you remove the 3, 5 is also prime
    5 is a single digit prime, so it is a deletable prime.
  Since 87253 was both prime, and recursively composed of deletable primes

First, we note that there are elements in the set of prime numbers that are NOT in the set of deletable primes:
  For example, 19 is a prime number. However, it is not a single digit, nor does it hold property (B)
    If you were to remove the digit 1, the resulting number, 9, is not prime
    If you were to remove the digit 9, the resulting number, 1, is not prime
    Therefore, 19 is in the set of primes, but not in the set of deletable primes
  However, there are not any elements of the set of deletable primes that are not themselves included in the set of primes
    This is by definition, as one of the criterions for being a deletable prime is being prime
  Therefore, the set of deletable primes is a proper subset of the set of primes.
Given that the cardinality of the set of all primes is countably infinite,
  the cardinality of the set of deletable primes is either countably infinite or finite.


Now, we attempt to construct the set of all deletable primes.
  First, we start with the set of all single-digit primes, {2, 3, 5, 7},
    as these are deletable primes by definition. We will call this set DP1
  Next, we create a set of all 2-digit numbers that are constructed by
    appending or prepending a digit to elements of DP1, not including leading 0's:
      That is, {12, 22, 32, 42, 52,... 20, 21, 23, 24, 25,... 13, 33, 43,... 30, 31,..., 79}
      The cardinality of this set, before removing repeats, is 19*|DP1| = 19*4 = 76.
        However, when prepending or appending elements of the current set, you count that value twice
          For example, when prepending and appending 2 to 2, 22 should only be counted once, but it is currently counted twice

        So, to address the disparity, we remove the square of the previous cardinality,
          that is, the cardinality of our new set is 19*|DP1| - |DP1|^2 = 19*4 - 4^2 = 60

      The cardinality of this new set is 60.
    We now reduce this set down to only include the elements that are deletable primes.
    This set is as follows:
      {13, 17, 23, 29, 31, 37, 43, 47, 53, 59, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 97}
      <diligence to be done on proving the validity of this set>
      We will name this set DP2
  Next, we create a set of all 3-digit numbers that are constructed, similarly,
    by appending or prepending a digit to elements of DP2, not including leading 0's:
      That is, {113, 213, 313, ... 978, 979}
      The cardinality of this set, before removing repeats, is 19*|DP2| = 304.
        However, we have repeats to deal with here too.
        The way we remove these repeats is to count the number of
